### ðŸ”§ Role Management Best Practices:
1. **First Admin**: Manually promote the first user to admin via SQL
2. **Role Changes**: Currently via SQL - you may want to build an admin interface later
3. **Audit Trail**: All role changes are automatically logged in the audit_trails table
4. **Security**: RLS policies enforce role-based data access

The system is ready for Sprint 3 implementation!
