## ü§ñ AI-Specific Testing Guidance

### **Scope Chat Behavior**

**Typical Interactions:**
```
User: "We need a new patient management system"
AI: "I can help you define requirements for a patient management system. Let me ask a few questions:
1. What type of healthcare facility is this for?
2. Do you need integration with existing EHR systems?
3. What are your key workflow requirements?"
```

**Edge Case Testing:**
```
Restrictive Input: "Only Microsoft-certified vendors allowed"
Expected Response: "‚ö†Ô∏è I noticed potentially restrictive language. Consider broadening vendor qualifications to 'vendors with equivalent certification' for better competition."

Vague Input: "We need something better"
Expected Response: "Could you provide more details about what you're looking to improve? This will help me suggest specific requirements."
```

### **Compliance AI Analysis**

**Restrictive Language Detection:**
- "Only [specific vendor]"
- "Must be located in [specific city]"
- "Minimum 20 years experience" (overly specific)
- "Exactly matches our current system"

**Trade Agreement Triggers:**
- Value > $121,200 CAD
- Timeline < 30 days posting period
- Services covered under CETA/CUSMA
